OBJECTIVE:

This program will allow the user to play hangman against the computer using a list of words from text file.
-Function that randomly selects a word from the text dictionary
-Function that takes input from the user which will be the letter guessed
-Function that will take the letters guessed correctly and turn them into a string
-Need to create various variables to store the users inputted data
    -Variable for the word that the computer picks
    -Create a set of data that holds the letters guessed wrong and the letters guessed correctly by the user. 
-We need to display an intro to the program
-Build a repetitive system, so that the user can keep guessing the letter
-If the user guesses wrong a new part fo the body is drawn, until they lose. (Guesses left goes down/ wrong guesses goes up)
-Add statements to the end and begginning that welcome and thank the user for playing
